GluttoDuck
==========

Game made in 48 hours for GCA 2014!


The DOOM TEAM proudly presents Glutto Duck, a game about a duck who wants to eat a unicorn to fulfill his ultimate eating fantasy.


However, in order to reach it, he must eat rainbow enchanted-candies and make good use of magical rainbow gates to keep him in flight. Due to his glutto-nature, his farts are strong enough to propel him to unseen heights. Fun cut-scenes were used to illustrate the premise of the story to newcomers. Can you catch the unicorn?


This game is created using the Unity3D game engine (free edition) version 4.3.3 and is targeted at Android devices. We chose this engine because it is one of the first versions to have support for native 2D games.

A tutorial little tutorial is included at the start to explain how to play.


Good luck!

-Doom Team.
